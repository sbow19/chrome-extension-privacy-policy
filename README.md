# chrome extension privacy policy: Vocab-Tracker
Effective Date: 11 April, 2025

I respect and value your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how I handle and protect your personal information in relation to your use of my Vocab Tracker Google Chrome extension(s).

Information Collection
Vocab Tracker works by taking text that you highlight on any website and then sending that text securely over HTTPS connection to a backend server. The server then forwards the highlighted text, along with translation parameters, to DeepL for translation. The translated text is returned to the backend server and forwarded to the Chrome Extension to be displayed back to the user. At no point is the text stored in the backend server. 

Vocab Tracker implements data persistence solely on the client-side, that is on the user's device, via the IndexedDB web API.

Vocab Tracker does not otherwise on its own gather, store, inspect, or transmit any data that can be used to personally identify you, such as your name, email address, or location. None of the text that you translate is stored or otherwise used for any other purpose, except for it to be transmitted to DeepL API for translation processing. None of the text is sold to third parties.

For Vocab Tracker to provide any meaningful value to you, the user, it fundamentally requires the ability to transmit text selected by you to DeepL for translation processing.

Links to Other Websites
My Google Chrome Extensions may contain links to other websites not operated by me. This Privacy Policy does not cover how that website processes personal information. I encourage you to review the Privacy Policy of every website that you visit.

Changes to this Privacy Policy
I reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised Privacy Policy, and the "Effective Date" above will be updated. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

By using my Google Chrome Extensions, you signify your consent and agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please refrain from using my Google Chrome Extensions.

Feedback
If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, you can contact me by email.
